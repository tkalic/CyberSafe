# Phishing & Fraud Protection: Recognizing and Avoiding Online Scams

## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a method cybercriminals use to deceive you into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or login credentials. These attacks often come via email, SMS, phone calls, or even fake websites.

## ⚠️ Types of Phishing Attacks to Know (Classic & Evolving)

### 1. **Email Phishing**

Fake emails pretending to be from legitimate companies urging you to click malicious links or attachments. 

### 2. **Spear Phishing**

Highly targeted emails using personal information (name, position) to make the message more convincing. Scammers can easily get a lot of infos about you through the internet.

### 3. **Whaling**

Aimed at executives or high-ranking individuals in an organization, with carefully crafted messages.

### 4. **Smishing (SMS Phishing)**

Fraudulent text messages that link to fake login pages or prompt quick actions like confirming deliveries.

### 5. **Vishing (Voice Phishing)**

Scammers call pretending to be from banks, government offices, or tech support.

### 6. **Clone Phishing**

Attackers duplicate a legitimate email but replace links and attachments with malicious ones.

### 7. **Quishing (QR-Code Phishing)**

Fraudsters embed malicious links inside QR codes placed in emails, fake letters, or public spaces (e.g. fake bank QR codes or EV charging stations).

### 8. **AI-Generated Phishing**

Attackers use AI to create highly realistic, personalized emails free of typical red flags like poor spelling or awkward grammar.

### 9. **Emotional Triggers**

Messages designed to create panic, curiosity, urgency, or fear — such as threats of account closure or "your child is in danger"-style scams.

### 10. **Deepfake Voice & Video**

Using AI to impersonate voices or faces in video calls or voicemails (e.g. “your boss” asking you to transfer money).

### 11. **Crypto Phishing**

Fake wallets, airdrops, or trading sites created to steal your crypto assets.



A lot of times it's a combination. For example a mix of email phishing and emotional triggers, assisted by personal information.

## 🕵️ How to Recognize a Phishing Attempt

✅ Generic greetings like “Dear customer” instead of your name\
✅ Urgent or threatening tone\
✅ Unexpected attachments or links\
✅ Grammar and spelling errors\
✅ HTML tricks to **mask real links** behind fake text (e.g. link says `paypal.com` but leads elsewhere)\
